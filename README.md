## Lab Details

### Lab 1: Unix and the Command Line Environment
**Objective**: Introduce Unix basics and CLI commands via a text-based game.

- **Activities**:
  - Play *Terminus*, a game to learn Unix commands.
  - Document all discovered commands and their usage.
  - Create a map of the game area using Graphviz.

---

### Lab 2: The Unix Filesystem
**Objective**: Recreate a simulated Unix filesystem and learn basic file management commands.

- **Activities**:
  - Reconstruct a filesystem hierarchy.
  - Understand the purpose of common directories like `/bin`, `/home`, and `/boot`.
  - Explore hidden files and environment variables.

---

### Lab 3: Branches, Merging, and Conflicts in Git
**Objective**: Learn Git branching, merging, and resolving conflicts through a collaborative chess game project.

- **Activities**:
  - Fix and merge conflicting branches for a chess program.
  - Ensure the program meets specific functional requirements.

---

### Lab 4: Shell Scripting
**Objective**: Automate tasks using Bash scripts.

- **Activities**:
  - Write scripts to check file existence, create backups, and process command-line arguments.
  - Dynamically handle variable input for script operations.

---

### Lab 5: Benchmarking and Profiling
**Objective**: Analyze the performance of search algorithms and memory usage.

- **Activities**:
  - Benchmark linear, binary, and Fibonacci search algorithms.
  - Estimate memory usage using GNU `time`.
  - Compare algorithm efficiency with profiling tools.

---

### Lab 6: Environment Variables and Libraries
**Objective**: Understand environment variables and create static/dynamic libraries in C.

- **Activities**:
  - Explore environment variables like `$PATH` and `$HOME`.
  - Create and use static and dynamic libraries with GCC.
  - Modify Bash startup scripts for customization.

---

### Lab 7: Testing and Makefiles
**Objective**: Automate compilation and testing using Makefiles.

- **Activities**:
  - Implement programs (`max.c`, `square.c`, etc.) with command-line arguments.
  - Create a Makefile for automatic compilation.
  - Perform automated testing with provided datasets.

---

### Lab 8: Continuous Integration
**Objective**: Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing.

- **Activities**:
  - Configure CI workflows for C projects using Makefiles.
  - Write YAML configuration files for GitHub Actions.
  - Explore Dockerfile basics.

---

### Lab 9: Documentation with Doxygen
**Objective**: Generate project documentation using Doxygen.

- **Activities**:
  - Create a `Doxyfile` to configure documentation generation.
  - Use Doxygen to document structs, functions, and file headers.
  - Host documentation on GitHub Pages.

---

### Lab 10: Pipes, Filters, and Regular Expressions
**Objective**: Work with advanced Unix tools like `grep`, `sed`, and regular expressions.

- **Activities**:
  - Solve tasks using glob patterns and pipes.
  - Use `sed` for find-and-replace operations.
  - Explore multiline matching with regular expressions.
