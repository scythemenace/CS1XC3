Q1 How are the iterative and recursive algorithms similar and different for the same test cases?
Which has more repetition?
Ans The iterative and recursive algorithms for calculating factors are similar in that they both produce the same output for the same input number.
However, they differ in their implementation: the iterative algorithm calculates factors using loops and division, 
while the recursive algorithm calculates factors using recursion and a list of prime factors.
Q2 What is the most executed line in the iterative and recursive algorithms? Are they the same?
Ans The function call is ran the most in recursive algorithms and in the iterative algorithms the iterative loop is ran the most times.
Q3 Are there any parts of the code which are not exercised?
Ans  printarray is never used.
Q4  If we were to try to optimize either function, where would be a good place to start?
Ans  good place to start would be caching
